          Most AI competitions reward whoever has the most compute, the most
          recent paper, and the patience to babysit a training run for fifteen
          hours. HackNova is built differently. The model is fixed. The
          architecture is fixed. The only thing you can change is the dataset
          itself - and that is where the real signal lives.

        <Section title="01 · The thesis">
          <p>
            Every production AI team you admire has the same dirty secret:
            their week-to-week wins almost never come from a new architecture.
            They come from spotting the seven mislabeled images that pulled the
            model in the wrong direction, or the one rare class that the
            sampler quietly starved.
          </p>
          <p>
            We chose this format because it forces builders to confront the
            actual job. You will not impress us with a transformer you found on
            arxiv last week. You will impress us by looking at your data the
            way a writer looks at a draft - closely, repeatedly, and with the
            willingness to throw away the ten percent that&apos;s lying to you.

            On day one you will receive a small labeled image set, a frozen
            classifier, and a much larger pool of unlabeled candidates. Your
            job for the next twenty-four hours is to decide which of those
            candidates are worth labeling, label them well, and feed them back
            until the model on the held-out set climbs.

            Final accuracy is the visible metric, but it is not the whole
            story. We will read your write-up. We will look at the trajectory
            of your runs. Two teams can land within half a point of each other
            and one of them will win comfortably because they made decisions on
            purpose, and the other one trusted the leaderboard.

            and which one you almost gave up on before you noticed the tell.

            You do not need to have shipped a model in production. You do not
            need three years of PyTorch on your résumé. You need to be the kind
            of person who, when the metric stops moving, does not immediately
            reach for a different optimizer. You reach for the data.
